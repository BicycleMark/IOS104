        <h2>Add a launch screen and app icons (IOS104)</h2>
<p>Making your app recognizable to users is an important part of establishing a brand. It starts with your app store listing, continues with your app icons, and finishes with your in-app graphics. This course concentrates on the middle part of that process. It shows you how to use icons and a launch screen to establish a consistent look for your app. You will use an asset catalog to organize your icons and include them in your project. Then you will design a storyboard launch screen and make it responsive so it works on all devices. By the end of the course, you will have an app with an eye-catching icon that looks great on the home screen and at startup.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Configure an iOS app with all the required and optional icons</li>
<li>Create a responsive storyboard launch screen for your iOS app</li>
</ul>
